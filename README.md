SASS Starter - SCSS for SMACSS

Starter code for SASS based on [Scalar and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS)](https://smacss.com/).
SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. This allows for more customization to the structure as we see fit.

Visit this [link](https://sshikhrakar.github.io/Sass-Starter/) for documentation.

## Features

* SMACSS structure for SASS.
* Mixins for BEM naming conventions and Media queries.
* SASS functions for unit conversions.
* Bootstrap Grid and Print CSS.
* Normalize CSS.
* Live reloading with BrowserSync.
* Packages such as JS/CSS minification and CSS autoprefixer included.

## Getting Started

#### Initial Checks:

* Install `node` and `npm`, `yarn` (recommended) if not installed.

#### Installation:

1. Clone Sass-Starter repo with `git clone git@github.com:sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter.git` (using SSH - recommended) or `git clone https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter.git` (using HTTPS) or download the zip.
2. Go to your project folder using a terminal, and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. After installing npm packages, run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the server. Your default browser will open automatically and the server will be hosted at `http://localhost:8080`.
