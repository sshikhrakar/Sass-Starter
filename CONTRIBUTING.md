# Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Sass Starter.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Sass Starter is an open source project and contributions are always welcomed. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Sass Starter itself.

# Ground Rules

Responsibilities:

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution?

Unsure where to begin contributing to Sass Starter? You can start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter/issues).

Here are a couple of useful links: [Make a pull request](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [First timer only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   - Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
   - Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
   - Send a pull request.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
As a rule of thumb, small changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

- Spelling / grammar fixes
- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- Comment clean up
- Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
- Adding logging messages or debugging output
- Changes to ‘metadata’ files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
- Moving source files from one directory or package to another.

# How to report a bug

File a bug by opening an [issue](https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter/issues/new).

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of SASS are you using?
2. What operating system and browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

> [Open an issue](https://github.com/sshikhrakar/Sass-Starter/issues/new) on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
